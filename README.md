# EMC & FE ++

**EMC & FE ++** 是一个较为休闲的整合包。正如其名，本整合包的主题是魔法与科技，即 EMC（等价交换）与 FE。等价交换可以为科技模组提供帮助。由 等价交换 => 无尽贪婪 => 极限反应堆 => 龙之研究 的路线发展。也有其它模组，如 Create、MEK 等，最终目标是使用各种模组的终极物品制作炼金术秘卷！

对整合包有任何意见 / 遇到问题可以在 Issue 反馈。

## 建议
最低 RAM 分配：4 GB

推荐 RAM 分配：8 GB

## Optifine
此整合包与 Optifine 不兼容。请不要将其添加到包中，因为它与一些模组冲突。本整合包的优化很好，有 Embeddium、FerriteCore 等模组，保证配置极低也可流畅游玩。

## 更新计划
正在制作英文版，制作完成会发到 Curseforge。

**EMC & FE ++** is a casual consolidation modpack. As the name suggests, the theme of this modpack is magic and technology, which is EMC (ProjectE) and FE (Forge Energy). ProjectE can help with tech mods. Developed by the route of ProjectE => Re:Avaritia => Extreme Reactors => Draconic Evolution. There are also other mods like Create, MEK, ... with the ultimate goal of crafting Tome of Knowledge with the ultimate items of various mods!

If you have any comments/problems with the modpack, you can report it in the Issue.

## Suggestion
Minimum RAM allocation: 4 GB

Recommended RAM allocation: 8 GB

## Optifine
This modpack is not compatible with Optifine. Please don't add it to the modpack as it conflicts with some mods. This modpack is very well optimized, with mods such as Embeddium, FerriteCore to ensure smooth gameplay even with very low specs.

## Update the plan
The English version is in the works, and it will be sent to Curseforge when it is completed.
